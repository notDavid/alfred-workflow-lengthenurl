Usage
======

- Typing `url` followed by a shortened url (bit.ly/* , t.co/* , tinyurl.com/*, etc) will reveal the original link. For example, `url bit.ly/a` will result in http://www.apple.com. Hitting enter will open the (shortened) url.

- When selecting text of an url in any app/document, the shortcut key `Command+Shift+U` can be used to open & show the selected text (url) in Alfred.


See what the hell you're opening, before opening it =)
